## Introduction
This is a simple web-based implementation of the classic game "Rock Paper Scissors." In this game, the player competes against the computer in a series of rounds, choosing between rock, paper, or scissors. The winner of each round is determined based on the rules of the game: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.

## How to Play
The game interface will be displayed, showing options for Rock, Paper, and Scissors.
Click on the button corresponding to your chosen move (Rock, Paper, or Scissors).
After making your choice, the computer will randomly select its move, and the winner of the round will be announced on the screen.
The game will continue for a predefined number of rounds or until you decide to quit.
After each round the result will be displayed, showing the number of rounds you won, lost, and the number of ties.
